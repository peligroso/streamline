Interface BalsamiqImport</H2>
<HR>
<DL>
<DT><PRE>public interface <B>BalsamiqImport</B></DL>
</PRE>

<P>
<h3>Reify (Balsamiq Importer)</h3>
 <a href='http://balsamiq.com' onclick="window.open('http://balsamiq.com');return
 false;">Balsamiq</a> is a tool for rapidly &amp; collaboratively
  creating mockups of user interfaces.  Smart GWT Pro and better includes a tool
  called <i>Reify</i> that allows you take exported Balsamiq mockups (.bmml files)
  and instantly turn them into interactive Smart GWT applications backed by clean, clear
  code.  This allows you to:
  <ul>
  <li> speed up development by reusing all the careful layout work you did in Balsamiq 
  <li> use Balsamiq as a development tool for Smart GWT, since you can re-import at any time
  or even continuously
  <li> instantly create a fully interactive version of a Balsamiq mockup in any Smart GWT skin
  <li> offer such functionality to your end users as a means of extending your application
 (<i>requires <a href='http://smartclient.com/product'
 onclick="window.open('http://smartclient.com/product');return false;">Visual Builder OEM
 license</a></i>)
  </ul>
  <h3>Using the tool</h3>
  <P>
  There are two ways to use Reify:
  <ul>
  <li> as a standalone tool: go to &lt;project base&gt;/tools/bmmlImporter.jsp and an import
  dialog similar to Visual Builder's File -&gt; Import dialog will immediately appear.  
  
  For example, if your bootstrap .html file is at
  <i>/myProject/start.html</i>,
  the importer should be at <i>/myProject/tools/bmmlImporter.jsp</i> (be sure your project
  imports the same tools module required to run Visual Builder).
  
  <li> in Visual Builder: in the "Screens" tab of the "Project" pane click on the "Add..."
  button and select "Import from Balsamiq".  You can provide the Balsamiq mockup file in
  various ways; providing a file will automatically load the screen created from the imported
  Balsamiq mockup into Visual Builder for further editing.
  </ul>
  Then, in both cases, what you want to save for further work is the XML source generated by
 the tool, which is called <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/docs/ComponentXML.html" title="interface in com.smartgwt.client.docs"><CODE>Component XML</CODE></A>.  In
 Visual Builder, you
  can copy and paste the XML from the "Code" tab; with the standalone tool you can press the
  "Show Source" button and copy and paste from there.
  <P>
  When using the standalone tool and running the server on your own machine, when you use the
  "Select file.." option to import a mockup from a file on disk, this tool will periodically
  re-import the mockup, so you can work in Balsamiq and the browser will periodically refresh,
  showing the Smart GWT version updated to reflect your latest changes.
  <P>
 Both tools can also save to a file under webroot.  In Visual Builder, use File-&gt;Save As.  In
  the standalone tool, use the "Output File" text field in the initial dialog.  This is most
  useful if you are using an "exploded" deployment .  If you are using the Eclipse IDE 
 with the built-in Jetty server, saving under webroot may not be useful since it means saving to
  a generated "deployment directory", not your Eclipse project.  In this case copy and paste
  is the best way to grab the generated source code.
  <P>
  For both tools, you can add the URL parameter "mockup" to cause your mockup to be immediately
  imported as the tool starts up:
  <pre>
    tools/bmmlImporter.jsp?mockup=myMockup.bmml
  </pre>
  This makes your imported mockup into something you can bookmark.
  <P>
  For the standalone tool, you can also add the URL parameter "outputFile" to specify where the
  generated XML source should be saved.  This makes the entire import &amp; save process
  bookmarkable, but again is most valuable in an "exploded" deployment.
  <P>
  The next sections explain how Reify works, and how to tweak your Balsamiq mockup to
  produce the best results, then the section "From imported mockup to application" explains how
  to turn your generated Smart GWT code into a working application.
  <P>
  <h3>Containers &amp; Layout</h3>
  <P>
  Most Balsamiq mockup elements have a direct Smart GWT equivalent - what Balsamiq calls a
  "Tabs Bar" is translated to a Smart GWT TabSet component, a Balsamiq "Accordion" is
  translated to a Smart GWT SectionStack, and so on.  However, rather than only translate
  elements 1-to-1, Reify uses heuristics to try to organize your components into layout
  managers and logical forms, as follows.
  <P>
  <h4>Containers</h4>
  <P>
  Balsamiq mockups have no true notion of containers - to put something "in" a container in
  Balsamiq, you just make sure it <i>visually</i> appears inside of the container - you never
  <i>assign</i> it as a child of the container.  If Reify did the same thing, the
  resulting code wouldn't be very useful because the screen would become jumbled if anything was
  resized.  Instead, Reify detects that you have placed something inside the visual area of
  a container and automatically creates a true container relationship in Smart GWT.  A grid
  inside of a Window really will be <i>inside</i> that Window in Smart GWT, and will move with
  the window if it is dragged.
  <P>
  It's also OK to be inexact.  If you look at a typical Balsamiq mockup, if an element doesn't
  have a visible right/bottom border its very common that its logical extents go outside of it's
  container.  Reify automatically recognizes such elements as contained anyway.  If
  something is sticking very far out of its container and Reify didn't realize it was
  meant to be contained, just fix the size in your mockup, and re-run import.
  <P>
  Reify will also recognize extra controls in the header area of a container.  For
  example, just placing buttons or icons in a Window's header area will lead to
 <CODE>headerControls</CODE> being created,
 similarly, placing controls in an Accordion's
 section will lead to <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/widgets/layout/SectionStackSection.html#getControls()"><CODE>section header controls</CODE></A> being created.
  <P>
  <h4>Stacks &amp; Layouts</h4>
  <P>
  Reify recognizes when you have stacked together several things of the same approximate
  size and assumes they go together.  It's OK to be inexact - Reify will ignore small
 differences in size and alignment and still realize that several items are meant to end up in a
  Layout.  If there are two or more possibilities for how elements can be arranged into Layouts,
  Reify will generally pick the option that results in the simplest overall layout.
  <P>
  <h4>Space Filling &amp; Fluid Layout</h4>
  <P>
  By default, Reify assumes your mockup isn't really meant to be fixed size - whatever
  container it's placed into, whether that's the whole browser or something smaller, your design
  is actually intended to fill it.
  <P>
  To achieve this, Reify defaults to ignoring any blank space that appears around the
  outside of the your mockup (ignoring markup elements - see below).  Then, Reify tries to
  find a way to allow your design to "flex" by finding elements that can use more space: grids,
  text areas, accordions, etc.  These elements are given flexible size and layout settings are
  applied to all of their parents such that resizing the mockup as a whole will give available
  space to the components that can use it.
  <P>
 To get the best results from this system, pay close attention to whether or not you are filling
  containers - Reify will only assume that a given component would like more space if it
  is <i>already</i> taking up as much space as possible in the mockup.  For example, if you have
  a grid as the sole member of a tab, but the grid only fills half the tab, Reify will
  assume the grid should be fixed size rather than fill the tab.
 <!-- TODO: add support for custom setting to avoid flexing one component, or even actual
 dimension
  setting -->
  <P>
  If you really want the entire mockup to be exactly the sizes you specified, this fluid layout
  behavior is one of the things you can turn off right in the import dialog: uncheck "Fill
  Space" if the design should not be made into a fluid layout, and uncheck "Trim Space" if you
  meant the empty space around the mockup to be taken literally.
  <P>
  <h4>Markup Elements</h4>
  <P>
  Elements such as Sticky Notes are considered "markup" and are dropped by default since it's
  assumed you don't want them now that you are moving on to creating your real application.
  You can retain them if you'd like by unchecking "Drop Markup" in the importer dialog.
  <P>
  Also, if you right-click on a component in Balsamiq (or option-click on MacOS), the menu item
  "Treat as Markup" allows you to convert a normal component into markup, which gives you a
  way to have Reify ignore selected components. 
  <P>
  <h3>Linked Mockups</h3>
  <P>
  Balsamiq supports
 <a href='http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/111742'
 onclick="window.open('http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/111742');return
 false;">linking multiple mockups together</a> 
  to create basic interactivity for guided walkthroughs of
  multi-screen mockups.  Reify understands that certain types of Balsamiq links and can
  create a combined appliction from several linked mockups, with the interactivity you would
  expect.
  <P>
  However, linking <i>only</i> works when mockups are loaded via the "Select file.." option
  and exist on disk at correct relative paths (the same relative locations where Balsamiq
  stores them); linking cannot be used with mockups that are uploaded using the web interface.
  <P>
  <h4>Links on Tabs</h4>
  <P>
  A common idiom used in Balsamiq to create the illusion of functioning tabs is to create a
  link on a tab that points to another mockup which is <i>exactly the same</i> except for the
  selected tab and contents of the tab pane.  Reify will recognize this idiom and take
 the contents of the selected tab from the linked mockup and place it in the same-named tab from
  the primary mockup.  As intended, the contents will be initially hidden since the tab will not
  be initially selected, and will be revealed when an end user clicks on the tab.  All other
  content from the linked mockup is ignored.
  <P>
  Unlike other aspects of Reify that compensate for small differences, here it is required
  that the two mockups be exactly the same except for the selected tab and tab contents.  The
  only elements that can differ are "markup" elements such as Sticky Notes.
  <P>
  <h4>Links on Accordions</h4>
  <P>
  Similar to the idiom for multiple tabs, links on Accordion components are sometimes used to
  point to mockups that are identical except for the expanded Accordion section.  Reify 
  will recognize this idiom in the same way as for tabs, and create a SectionStack where the
  contents of the visible Accordion section from the linked mockup appear in an initially
  collapsed section in the imported application.
  <P>
  <h4>Other links</h4>
  <P>
  A link on an element such as a button that leads to a second mockup will, by default, cause
  both the primary and linked mockup to be imported with all of their components, and an event
  handler will be generated on the button that simply hides all the components of the primary
  mockup and shows all the components of the linked mockup.  
  <P>
  If this is not correct (perhaps the linked mockup is really intended to be the same screen,
  with various changes caused by the button), simply remove the link before importing.  You can
  then add event handling logic to implement the intended effect of the button.  You can also
  separately import the linked mockup and load it as an additional screen - see the follow
  sections on going from imported mockup to full applications.
  <P>
  <h4>Symbols &amp; Assets</h4>
  <P>
  Balsamiq has a concept of
 <a href='http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/110439'
 onclick="window.open('http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/110439');return
 false;">symbols</a>, which are
  reusable elements that can be incorporated into multiple mockups.  Reify supports
  symbols, however, like linked mockups, symbols are only supported when the mockup file and
  symbol file are both present on disk and do not need to be uploaded.  The symbols file
  should be in the same location relative to the mockup as Balsamiq expects it -
  <i>assets/symbols.bmml</i> by default.
  <P>
  <h3>From imported mockup to application</h3>
  <P>
  Once you've imported your mockup, making it into a real application involves 3 things:
  <ol>
  <li> loading the mockup into a larger application (or as the entire application)
  <li> connecting to real DataSources
  <li> adding event handlers and other programmatic logic
  </ol> 
  <P>
  <h4>Loading the mockup as an application</h4>
  <P>
  To load your imported mockup into an application, see the "Loading screens stored in
 Component XML" section of the <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/docs/ComponentXML.html" title="interface in com.smartgwt.client.docs"><CODE>Component XML
 overview</CODE></A>.
  <P>
  <h4>Connecting to real DataSources</h4>
  <P>
  First, be sure you have read the QuickStart Guide chapters on Data Binding and the Server
  Framework so that you are familiar with DataSources, .ds.xml files and how DataSources are
  loaded into your application.  Then, consider the different data-aware widgets in the
  application created from your mockup:
  <P>
  <b>Grids and Trees</b>
  <P>
  Sample data provided for grids and trees in the mockup is converted to a special kind of
  DataSource called a "MockDataSource", which is essentially a
 <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/data/DataSource.html#getClientOnly()"><CODE>clientOnly DataSource</CODE></A>.  There are two
 ways to replace these with
  real DataSources that save to a persistent store:
  <ul>
  <li> if you have already separately developed real DataSources: the simplest approach is to
  load your DataSources normally, then just delete the &lt;MockDataSource&gt; definitions from
  the XML source, and replace the <code>dataSource</code> attribute on the &lt;ListGrid&gt; or
  &lt;TreeGrid&gt; element with the ID of your real DataSource
  <li> if you want to start from the mockup DataSources: move the XML definition of the
  MockDataSource into a new .ds.xml file, rename the outer tag to just &lt;DataSource&gt;,
 add <code>clientOnly="true"</code> and remove the &lt;mockData&gt; element.  Load the
 DataSource
 normally and the application imported from the mockup will continue to function just as it has.
  You can now add settings to the new .ds.xml file to set up persistence (see QuickStart
  Guide) - remove the <code>clientOnly="true"</code> setting and &lt;cacheData&gt; element
  whenever you want to switch over to real persistence.
  </ul>
  <P>
  <b>Forms &amp; ValuesManagers</b>
  <P>
  As far as form controls (anything used to enter data), the basic rules are:
  <ul>
 <li> any series of adjacent form controls that have a roughly tabular layout will be created as
  a single DynamicForm
 <li> all DynamicForm controls within one container will share a common <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/widgets/form/ValuesManager.html" title="class in com.smartgwt.client.widgets.form"><CODE>ValuesManager</CODE></A>
  </ul>
  To connect these forms and ValuesManagers to DataSources, just set the "dataSource" attribute
  on the &lt;DynamicForm&gt; or &lt;ValuesManager&gt; elements respectively.  If Reify has
 created a ValuesManager linking two forms that should be attached to separate DataSources, just
  delete the &lt;ValuesManager&gt; declaration and corresponding &lt;valuesManager&gt; attribute
  on the forms that share the ValuesManager - they will now be independent forms that can use
  independent DataSources.
  <P>
  Bear in mind when adding DataSources: the FormItems within each DynamicForm will only be
 connected to the DataSource field if they <i>have the same name attribute</i>.  You'll notice
 the
  FormItems are given automatically generated names based on the label for the field in the
 mockup, for example, a title of "First Name" yields a field name of "First_Name".  You may need
  to edit these in order to match the names of your DataSource fields.
  <P>
  <h3>Setting IDs &amp; Custom Properties</h3>
  <P>
  If you right-click on a component in Balsamiq (or option-click on MacOS), a menu item
  "Custom Properties" allows you to set a "Custom control ID" and provide "Custom control
 data".  The "Custom control ID" will become <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/widgets/BaseWidget.html#getID()"><CODE>component.ID</CODE></A> for the
  Smart GWT component generated from the Balsamiq component.
  <P>
  You can use "Custom control data" to provide additional properties for the generated
  component, as a semicolon-separated set of properties and values.  For example this setting:
  <pre>
      showFilterEditor:true; border:"1px solid black"
  </pre>
  .. applied to a Balsamiq "Data Grid" would enable
 <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/widgets/grid/ListGrid.html#getShowFilterEditor()"><CODE>showFilterEditor</CODE></A> on the
 generated ListGrid.
  <P>
  
  <P>
  <h3>Event Handlers &amp; Scripting loaded components</h3>
  <P>
  See the section "Event Handlers &amp; Scripting loaded components" in the
  <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/docs/ComponentXML.html" title="interface in com.smartgwt.client.docs"><CODE>Component XML overview</CODE></A>.
  <P>
  <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
  <P>
  If you manage to get the importer to crash or do something clearly incorrect, we want to know
  about it.  Take the BMML file(s) that failed and post them to the
 <a href='http://forums.smartclient.com/'
 onclick="window.open('http://forums.smartclient.com/');return false;">forums</a> along with the
 exact version of your product
 (lower-left-hand corner of the Developer Console).  If you can isolate the exact portion of the
  mockup that causes the problem and save that as a separate file, that's very helpful in terms
  of fixing the problem as soon as possible.
  <P>
  In terms of getting past the problem while you wait for a fix, the easiest thing is to just
  remove the offending portion of the mockup.  You can then create that portion with normal
  coding techniques or with <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/docs/ComponentXML.html" title="interface in com.smartgwt.client.docs"><CODE>ComponentXML</CODE></A>.
