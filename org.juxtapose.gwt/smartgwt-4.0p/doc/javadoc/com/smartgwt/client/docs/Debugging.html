<h3>Debugging</h3>
 <h4>Built-in Diagnostics</h4>
  <P>
 The Smart GWT Developer Console is a suite of development tools implemented in Smart GWT
 itself. 
 The Console runs in its own browser window, parallel to your running application, so it is
 always 
  available in every browser, and in every deployment environment.
  <P>
 The Developer Console can be opened by calling <code>isc.showConsole()</code> on any page in
 which 
 Smart GWT has been loaded. You can create a bookmark in your browser to quickly show the
 Console on 
  any Smart GWT application, without any changes to the application code:
  <P>
  1. Create a new bookmark in your browser.<BR>
  2. Enter url "javascript:isc.showConsole()".<BR>
  3. Label the bookmark as "Show Console".<BR>
  4. Consider adding this to the Bookmarks Toolbar. This allows one-click access to the Console 
  from any Smart GWT application.
  <P>
 Note: For most browsers you can evaluate javascript directly from the browser URL bar by
 entering 
 <code>javascript:<i>string to evaluate</i></code> directly in the URL bar, so setting up a
 bookmark 
 is not strictly necessary. For Firefox 6 and above, this feature has been disallowed, but the
 bookmark 
  approach will still work. Alternatively developers could use 
 <a href='http://blog.mozilla.com/devtools/2011/08/15/introducing-scratchpad/'
 onclick="window.open('http://blog.mozilla.com/devtools/2011/08/15/introducing-scratchpad/');return
 false;">Firefox Scratchpad</a> 
  to launch the console.
  <P>
  Basic information on the features of the Developer Console can be found in the QuickStart
  Guide.  For information about the "RPC" tab of the Developer Console and the request 
  profiling information it can provide, see 
 <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/docs/DevConsoleRPCTab.html" title="interface in com.smartgwt.client.docs"><CODE>the Developer Console RPC tab</CODE></A>.  The remainder
 of this 
  topic focuses on use of the log system and related debugging facilities.
  <P>
  The Developer Console contains a "Results" pane that displays a list of diagnostic
  messages logged by the Smart GWT framework. The "Logging Preferences" menu lets you
  enable and disable Smart GWT's built-in diagnostics in several categories. Because
  important diagnostic messages may be logged at any time, you should have the Developer
  Console open whenever you are working with Smart GWT (and you should bookmark the
  "javascript:" expression above to make this easier).
  <P>
  Log messages are of the format:
  <P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>timestamp</i>:<i>priority</i>:<i>category</i>:<i>message</i>
  <P>
  For example, the following log message:
  <pre>
      11:59:25:806:INFO:Page:Page loading complete.</pre>
  Occurred at 11:59:25 local time and 806 milliseconds.  It's priority was <code>INFO</code>,
  it occurred in the category <i>Page</i>, and the message is "Page loading complete.".
  <P>
  Each logging <i>category</i> has a <i>priority</i> associated with it.  If a message's
  priority is lower than the current priority for the category it is logged in, the
  message will be suppressed (will not appear in the "Results" pane).  
  <p>
  It is critical to be familiar with the diagnostic categories built-in to Smart GWT - 
  you will use them in most debugging sessions.  Open the Logging Preferences menu and select
  "More.." to see a list of diagnostic log categories.   Hover over each category name to
  see a description of what kind of messages are logged in the category.  
  <P>
  <h4>Debugging JavaScript Errors</h4>
  <P>
 Javascript errors will typically be reported in the Developer Console. Wherever possible a
 stack 
  trace will be included which can help determine the cause of the error.
 In addition to this, recent versions of the Firefox browser (versions 6.0 and above) ship with
 some 
 useful development tools including the Error Console for reporting errors. We also recommend
 Console2 
  and Firebug for debugging in Firefox.
  <P>
  In Internet Explorer, when JS errors occur, Smart GWT is able to report full stack traces
  in the Developer Console.  This can be invaluable when your code triggers a JS error
  in the Smart GWT libraries themselves, or when it is unclear how your code is being
  called.  Stack traces from Internet Explorer should <i>always</i> be included in issue
  reports sent to Isomorphic Software, if at all possible. 
  <P>
  <h4>Inspecting application state</h4>
  <P>
  The "Evaluate JS Expression" area of the Results Pane in the Developer Console can be used
  to inspect the current state of a Smart GWT application.  Any Smart GWT or browser
  built-in API can be called from the "Evaluate JS Expression" area, and the results will
  be intelligently summarized (via  Log.echo).  For example, simply typing a
  component's ID and pressing the "Eval JS" button will give you a dump of it's current
  property values.  
  <P>
  Many, many Smart GWT APIs can be usefully called while troubleshooting, eg, 
 <CODE>data</CODE> is a <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/data/ResultSet.html" title="class in com.smartgwt.client.data"><CODE>ResultSet</CODE></A> when a grid is DataBound and 
 <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/data/ResultSet.html#get(int)"><CODE>ResultSet.get</CODE></A> can be called to inspect the
 current values on records.  In addition,
  new application code can be tried out, for example, you might repeatedly instantiate a new
  component, trying variants on the properties you could give it.
  <P>
  <b>Inspecting transient application state with logs</b>
  <P>
  Transient state, such as the values of local variables in a method that is crashing, can be
  sent to the Developer Console via using the Log class.  For example, to dump the
  value of the local variable "request": 
  <pre>
      isc.logWarn("request is: " + isc.echo(request));
  </pre>
  <P>
  It's a good idea to dump the values of local variables in any method that is crashing or
  behaving unexpectedly.
  <P>
 Note the use of <CODE>logWarn()</CODE> above: in typical
 debugging sessions,
  it's best
  to simply use <code>logWarn</code> method to output diagnostics to ensure your message will
  not be suppressed by log priority settings.
  <P>
  NOTE: never use the native <code>alert()</code> method to output diagnostics.  Among other
  issues, <code>alert()</code> can affect timing, masking or altering the behavior you were
  trying to debug.  Smart GWT's logging system doesn't suffer from these problems and
  provides much more control.
  <P>
  <h4>Issue Reports</h4>
  <P>
  If you believe you've discovered a bug in Smart GWT or you are having trouble using
 Smart GWT APIs, you can report it at <a href='http://forums.smartclient.com/'
 onclick="window.open('http://forums.smartclient.com/');return
 false;">http://forums.smartclient.com/</a>, or, if
  you have Enterprise Support, at the 
 <a href='http://support.isomorphic.com/'
 onclick="window.open('http://support.isomorphic.com/');return false;">Customer Support
 Extranet</a>.
  <P>
  <b>How quickly your issue is resolved is entirely up to you</b>.  If you follow the steps
  below and submit an appropriate issue report, you will generally receive a rapid solution
  from Isomorphic Support, regardless of what support level you have, because Isomorphic
  aggressively corrects bugs and legitimate usage issues.  If you skip steps you are likely to
  be directed back to this document and asked to submit a more complete issue report.
  <P>
  Before reporting an issue, ensure that you:
  <ul>
  <li> Have read the 'QuickStart Guide' cover to
  cover.  Later chapters cover more advanced topics and provide links to further examples and
  reference.
 <li> Have searched the ${isc.DocUtils.linkForDocNode('FeatureExplorer', 'Feature Explorer')}
 for examples that show
  what you are trying to do
  <li> Have searched this reference, trying multiple searches using different, common and
  related terms for what you are trying to do (eg for search, try "search", "filter",
  "criteria", "find", "match", etc)
 <li> Have searched the public <a href='http://forums.smartclient.com'
 onclick="window.open('http://forums.smartclient.com');return false;">forums</a>
  </ul>
  Always include:
  <ul>
  <li> A description of what you are trying to accomplish <b>from a user's perspective</b>.
  The best answers often point out a simpler approach.
  <li> The browser(s), operating system(s) and Smart GWT version(s) you experience the error
  on (Smart GWT version is available in the lower-left handle corner of the Developer
  Console)
  </ul>
  Then, include <b>either</b> a standalone test case (see below), <b>or</b>:
  <ul>
  <li> For JS errors, Stack traces from Firebug (for Firefox) or the Developer Console (for
  IE), as covered under "Debugging JavaScript Errors" above
  <li> Results of calling <code>echo()</code> on local variables or other application
  state you think is relevant (see "Inspecting Application State" above)
 <li> What server platform and <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/docs/ClientServerIntegration.html" title="interface in com.smartgwt.client.docs"><CODE>databinding approach</CODE></A> you
  are using, if applicable
  <li> contents of the Smart GWT Developer Console "Log messages" area, with appropriate
  diagnostic categories set the DEBUG or INFO level (see "Built-in Diagnostics" above)
  <li> sample code and sample data
  </ul>
  <b>Preparing a standalone test case</b>
  <P>
  A standalone test case is one of:
  <ol>
  <li> a chunk of JavaScript code that can be executed from the "Eval JS" area of the
  Developer Console on some specified page within the unmodified Smart GWT SDK,
  demonstrating your issue
  <li> an .html or .jsp file that can be dropped at a specified location into an unmodified
  Smart GWT SDK and will run without changes, demonstrating your issue.
  <li> a .zip file that includes a standalone .html/.jsp file  as above, as well as
  dependencies required to make the test case runnable, such as XML datasets
  </ol>
  <P>
  Submitting a standalone test case removes any ambiguity as to whether there is a bug in
  Smart GWT or a bug in your code, and eliminates the possibility of Isomorphic Support
  responding with a "works for me" result due to incomplete information.  Issues with verified
  test cases are routed directly to the engineer that authored the relevant Smart GWT
  subsystem, often as the new highest priority task.  In addition, the process of preparing a
  test case very often allows you to solve the issue yourself.
  <P>
  There are two approaches to test case preparation:
  <ol>
  <li> Add code to an existing Smart GWT example until you can reproduce the problem
 <li> Remove code from your application until it minimally shows the problem and runs standalone
  </ol>
  <P>
  For approach #1, find the nearest match to your use case in the
 ${isc.DocUtils.linkForDocNode('FeatureExplorer')} examples or in the other examples accessible
 from the Examples
  folder of the SDK, then try to minimally modify that example to demonstrate your issue.
  Feature Explorer examples are a particularly good starting point because you can simply copy
  the code from the Feature Explorer to the Eval JS area of the Developer Console and begin
  changing it, and if successful this yields a type #1 test case, the easiest for you to
  submit and most efficient for Isomorphic to work with.
  <P>
  For approach #2,
  <ol>
  <li> If a server is involved in initial page generation (eg a .jsp file), in most cases you
  can eliminate many server dependencies <b>and</b> create an easily modifiable starting point
  by using the browser's "View Source" feature to save a copy of the generated HTML output as
  an .html file in the same directory as the .jsp file that generated it.  Such a file will
  generally continue to function (all relative paths are still correct), and can be modified
  freely without the need to later revert changes to a .jsp.
  <li> Eliminate any code that isn't involved in the interaction.  Keep running the test case
  as you eliminate code to ensure you are still seeing the issue (you may solve it this way,
  or find key preconditions that you can report to Isomorphic)
  <li> For any issue that isn't cosmetic, revert to a default Smart GWT skin
  <li> For any necessary RPC/DataSource interactions, spoof the interaction with one of these
  approaches:
  <ul>
  <li> switch any DataSources to one of the sample DataSources from the SDK (eg "supplyItem")
  if your issue can still be reproduced in this case.
  <li> create a small sample dataset in JavaScript directly in the .html file, and use a
 <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/data/DataSource.html#getClientOnly()"><CODE>clientOnly DataSource</CODE></A> with that
 dataset.
  <li> capture server responses verbatim by setting the RPCManager log category to DEBUG, save
 the responses as flat files, and set <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/data/DataSource.html#getDataURL()"><CODE>dataURL</CODE></A> to point at them.
  <li> for RPCs, instead of calling the RPCManager, directly call your own callback function,
  passing a spoofed RPCResponse that includes just the fields your code depends upon
  </ul>
  <li> Finally, move your .html file into the stock Smart GWT SDK along with any remaining
  dependencies and verify the problem can still be reproduced
  </ol>
  Having prepared the test case, combine it with the other required issue report information
 covered above, and submit it to the <a href='http://forums.smartclient.com/'
 onclick="window.open('http://forums.smartclient.com/');return false;">forums</a>,
  or, if you have Enterprise Support, at the
 <a href='http://support.isomorphic.com/'
 onclick="window.open('http://support.isomorphic.com/');return false;">Customer Support
 Extranet</a>.
  <P>
  <h4>Adding your own diagnostic categories</h4>
  <P>
  Calling <code>logWarn()</code> is fine for a log statement you plan to delete at the end of
  the debugging session.  However, many log statements have lasting value if you could enable
  or disable them only when you need the relevant diagnostics, like Smart GWT's built-in
  diagnostic categories.  To do this, pick a priority level less than <code>WARN</code>
  (<code>INFO</code> or <code>DEBUG</code>), and call the corresponding method on the Log
  class (<code>logInfo()</code> or <code>logDebug()</code>), passing the category name as a
  second parameter.  For example:
  <pre>
    isc.Log.logInfo("first record is: " + 
                    isc.Log.echo(myGrid.data.get(0)), 
                   "myGridLoading");
  </pre>
  This message will no longer appear in the Results Pane by default, because its priority
  (<code>INFO</code>) is less than the default of <code>WARN</code>.  To see this message,
  open the Logging Preferences menu and pick "More..", then click the "Add" button, enter
  "myGridLoading" as the category name and set the priority to <code>INFO</code>.  The message
  will now appear next time it is logged.
  <P>
  Now you have a custom log category that you and other developers can use to debug your
  application, subsystem by subsystem.  These diagnostics will be available to you both in
  development and production environments.
  <P>
  As with Smart GWT's built-in diagnostics, you may choose to log certain messages in your
  custom category at the <code>DEBUG</code> level and a lesser number of messages at the
  <code>INFO</code> level, to create different depths of diagnostic output.
  <P>
  <h4>Logging refinements</h4>
  <P>
  The core log methods (<code>logDebug()</code>, <code>logInfo()</code>,
  <code>logWarn()</code>) and the "echo" facilities (<code>echo()</code> and
  <code>echoAll()</code>) are available on every Smart GWT component and Class.  Hence,
  in many cases, the special JavaScript value "this" will refer to an object that supports
  <code>logWarn()</code> et al.  For example:
  <pre>
      Canvas.create({
         ID:"canvasExample",
         contents:"Hello World!",
         click:"this.logWarn('the Canvas is: ' + this.echo(this))"
      });
  </pre>
  The special value "this" is not always set to a Smart GWT component, for example, in some
 kinds of callbacks (eg <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/widgets/grid/ListGrid.html#fetchData()"><CODE>fetchData()</CODE></A>).  When in doubt, use these
  methods via the Log class as <code>isc.Log.logWarn()</code>.
  <P>
  <b>Logging performance</b>
  <P>
  Because the log message is actually formed <i>before</i> the call to the log system, logs
  that are suppressed can still carry a performance penalty.  This is particularly true of
  logs that output a lot of data or occur frequently.  To avoid this penalty, you can check in
  advance whether a message will be suppressed using 
   isc.Log.logIsDebugEnabled() and
   isc.Log.logIsInfoEnabled().  For example:
  <pre>
    if (isc.Log.logIsInfoEnabled("myGridLoading")) {
       isc.Log.logInfo("first record is: " +
                       isc.Log.echo(myGrid.data.get(0)),
                       "myGridLoading");
    }
  </pre>
  Generally, it is only important to do this for logs that will occur multiple times during a
  given user interaction (eg a mousedown or keypress) and/or that call <code>echo()</code> on
  objects with many properties.
