<P>
<h3>DOM Integration &amp; Third-party Components</h3>
 Smart GWT provides a huge variety of pre-built components and allows you to create new
  components via combining and composing the existing components.  However in rare cases, it can
  make sense to write code that works directly with raw HTML and the browser's DOM (document
  object model) APIs.  This level of coding is also involved when integrating third-party
  JavaScript components into Smart GWT applications.
  <P>
  First, a warning: when you use HTML and the DOM directly, all of Smart GWT's guarantees of
  cross-browser consistent behavior no longer apply.  When you use Smart GWT's API, Smart GWT
  is automatically compensating for many, many browser bugs - not just trivial things like
  different property names or missing utility methods, but problems where browsers fail to fire
  certain events, report sizes wrong only in certain modes with certain styling, or bugs that
  only occur with specific timing.
  <P>
  Before deciding to do direct HTML coding, consider whether you really want to expose yourself
  to all of these possible issues.  If you can achieve the same look and feel and behavior
  through Smart GWT's APIs, that's usually best.
  <P>
  <h3>Adding or modifying the DOM</h3>
  <P>
  The DOM structures used by Smart GWT necessarily differ by browser in order to work around
  each browser's specific bugs.  This DOM structure is intentionally undocumented because it is
  subject to change without notice - in may be necessary to modify the DOM structure to work
  around the bugs in each new browser release.
  <P>
  Instead of trying to modify the Smart GWT-generated DOM, you should always <b>add new
  elements</b>.  For a new standalone component that will be based on direct use of HTML, you
 usually do this by subclassing Canvas and overriding <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/widgets/BaseWidget.html#getInnerHTML()"><CODE>Canvas.getInnerHTML</CODE></A> and returning
  an HTML string representing the components you want to create.
  <P>
  You can use a similar approach anywhere HTML is allowed in a widget property: formatting APIs
  for StaticTextItem, DetailViewer, TileGrid, and other DataBoundComponents, as well as places
 such as <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/widgets/tab/Tab.html#getTitle()"><CODE>title</CODE></A> or <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/widgets/Button.html#getTitle()"><CODE>title</CODE></A>.
  <P>
  <h3>Third-party components</h3>
  <P>
  Most third-party JavaScript components have the ability to generate their HTML content into a
  DOM element specified by ID, or to replace such an element with new HTML.  This is true of
 Google Maps, <a href='http://ckeditor.com' onclick="window.open('http://ckeditor.com');return
 false;">CKEditor</a> and many other libraries.
  <P>
 To use this form of integration, implement a <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/widgets/BaseWidget.html#getInnerHTML()"><CODE>Canvas.getInnerHTML</CODE></A> function that returns
  a DOM element with a known ID, then have the third-party library target that DOM element once
  the Canvas is drawn.  For example, CKEDITOR.replace() takes the ID of a &lt;textarea&gt;
  element, and the following code would create a &lt;textarea&gt; and have the CKEditor replace
  it with a CKEditor widget: 
  
  
  <pre>
  public class CKEditor extends Canvas {
  
      private static native void replace(String id) &#47;*-{
          $wnd.CKEDITOR.replace(id);
      }-*&#47;;
  
      public CKEditor() {
          setRedrawOnResize(false);
      }
  
      &#64;Override
      public String getInnerHTML() {
 return "&lt;textarea id='" + getID() + "_ckEditor'
 style='width:100%;height:100%'>&lt;/textarea>";
      }
  
      &#64;Override
      protected void onDraw() {
          CKEditor.replace(getID() + "_ckEditor");
      }
  }
  </pre>
  
  <P>
  This same approach can be used when you want to insert third-party generated HTML into just a
  specific part of a Smart GWT widget.  For example, you might want to insert 
 <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=jquery+sparklines'
 onclick="window.open('https://www.google.com/search?q=jquery+sparklines');return false;">JQuery
 'sparklines'</a>, which are
  essentially miniature charts, into cells of a ListGrid.  You could use
 <CODE>a cell formatter</CODE> to
 write out &lt;div&gt; elements with
  known IDs into the cells, then target them with JQuery.
  <P>
  <h3>Resizing and Redraw</h3>
  <P>
  When implementing <code>canvas.getInnerHTML()</code>, your getInnerHTML() function will be
 called every time the component redraw()s, and the new HTML will replace the old.  This is also
  true of something like a ListGrid cell formatter.
  <P>
  Also by default, your component will redraw() if it is resized.  In the example above with
 CKEditor, we wouldn't want this because it would wipe out the CKEditor widget every time it was
 resized, so we set <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/widgets/Canvas.html#getRedrawOnResize()"><CODE>redrawOnResize</CODE></A>
 to false.  In other circumstances you may want
  to redraw on every resize in order to generate new HTML.
  <P>
  If you do not redraw HTML on resize, you either have to write the HTML in a way that makes it
 flow into available space (width/height 100% may be enough here) <b>or</b> you need to manually
 resize the DOM element when the <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/widgets/Canvas.html#addResizedHandler(com.smartgwt.client.widgets.events.ResizedHandler)"><CODE>resized event</CODE></A> fires.  
  <P>
  In the latter case, you should adjust the size of the DOM element to match the
  <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/widgets/Canvas.html#getInnerWidth()"><CODE>inner width</CODE></A> and 
 <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/widgets/Canvas.html#getInnerHeight()"><CODE>inner height</CODE></A> of the containing
 Canvas.  The "inner" dimensions
  are the dimensions after border and margins have been subtracted, so this will work even if a
 border is added to your Canvas subclass via CSS or <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/widgets/Canvas.html#setBorder(java.lang.String)"><CODE>Canvas.setBorder</CODE></A>.
  <P>
  <h3>Other redraws</h3>
  <P>
 Once you have set <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/widgets/Canvas.html#getRedrawOnResize()"><CODE>redrawOnResize</CODE></A>
 to false you may still see redraws from other
  sources.  Generally this would be from code in your application which calls
 <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/widgets/Canvas.html#redraw()"><CODE>Canvas.redraw</CODE></A> or <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/widgets/Canvas.html#markForRedraw()"><CODE>Canvas.markForRedraw</CODE></A> unnecessarily.  To
 troubleshoot, you
  can enable the "redraws" log category in the Developer Console - this will log the source of
  any redraws in the system.
  <P>
  <h3>Auto-Sizing</h3>
  <P>
 With the default setting of <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/widgets/Canvas.html#getOverflow()"><CODE>overflow:"visible"</CODE></A>, an HTMLFlow will
  auto-size to fit content returned by <code>getInnerHTML()</code>.  However, if you
  subsequently modify the DOM inside the HTMLFlow, there is no cross-browser-reliable way for
  the HTMLFlow to detect this and auto-size again.  Instead, call
 <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/widgets/Canvas.html#adjustForContent(boolean)"><CODE>Canvas.adjustForContent</CODE></A> to trigger
 auto-sizing again.
  <P>
  <h3>zIndex</h3>
  <P>
  zIndex values control what component is rendered "on top" when multiple components appear in
  the same area of the page.
  <P>
  To work around various browser issues, Smart GWT components use a very high range of
  zIndex values.  If a component creates pop-up widgets such as hovers or floating toolbars
  via direct HTML/DOM usage, these pop-up widgets will appear <b>behind</b> all Smart GWT
  components unless they set a very high zIndex.  
  <P>
  For your own custom HTML/DOM components, the simplest strategy is to create pop-up widgets
  based on Smart GWT components, even if they are triggered by interacting with
  hand-created HTML.  For example, even if you've written some kind of advanced SVG-based data
  visualization component, you can still implement pop-up configuration dialogs based on the
 Smart GWT <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/widgets/Window.html" title="class in com.smartgwt.client.widgets"><CODE>Window</CODE></A> class; there's no reason to implement such
 dialogs directly in
  low-level HTML/DOM code.
  <P>
  If a third-party widget is creating pop-ups you don't directly control, you may be able to
  configure the third-party widget to use a certain zIndex range, or you may be able to
  directly reach into the widget's DOM and modify zIndexes that way.  You can use
 <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/widgets/Canvas.html#getZIndex()"><CODE>Canvas.getZIndex</CODE></A> to discover the zIndex of
 any Smart GWT widget you need to
  appear above, then set a higher value.
  <P>
  Finally, as a last resort and completely unsupported approach, you can modify the zIndex
  range used by Smart GWT using the following JavaScript code:
  <pre>
  isc.Canvas.addClassProperties({
     // default zIndex for the next item to be drawn
     _nextZIndex:200000,
 
     // zIndex of the next item to be sent to the back
     _SMALL_Z_INDEX:199950,
 
     // zIndex of the next item to be brought to the front
     _BIG_Z_INDEX:800000
  });
  </pre>
  <P>
  <h3>Other issues</h3>
  <P>
  There are several other issues, listed below, for which there really is no general strategy
  for solving the issue, although some general pointers are provided.
  <P>
  Because of problems like these, it's a very very bad idea to freely intermix components from
  multiple component libraries.  While mixing components may appear to be an appealing
  strategy and you may experience apparent success with early attempts, the issues below will
  ultimately prevent you from completing an application of sufficient quality for enterprise
  use.
  <P>
  In the following discussion, "third-party widgets" should be understood to include
  widgets that you write using direct DOM/HTML techniques.
  <ul>
  <li> <b>tabbing order / accessibility</b>: a correct tabbing order that visits all
  components on the page is a requirement for your application to be considered accessible, as
 is ARIA markup (for more information, see <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/docs/Accessibility.html" title="interface in com.smartgwt.client.docs"><CODE>Accessibility</CODE></A>). 
 Third-party
  widgets may completely lack ARIA markup, such that you may be required to modify them or
  reach into their DOM to add ARIA attributes.  It may be necessary to add manual keyDown or
  keyPress event handlers to handle focus moving from Smart GWT components to third-party
  widgets and back.
 
  <li> <b>modality</b>: aside from zIndex issues covered above, modality means that the tab
  order should be a closed loop that reaches only active widgets, which can create additional
  complexity in getting tabbing to work correctly.  Also, keyboard shortcuts should be
  disabled for inactive widgets; this may require calls to
 <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/util/EventHandler.html#targetIsMasked(com.smartgwt.client.widgets.Canvas)"><CODE>EventHandler.targetIsMasked</CODE></A> to
 make third-party widgets respect Smart GWT
 modality, or may require calls to <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/widgets/Canvas.html#showClickMask(com.smartgwt.client.core.Function, com.smartgwt.client.types.ClickMaskMode, com.smartgwt.client.widgets.Canvas[])"><CODE>Canvas.showClickMask</CODE></A> to cause Smart GWT
  components to consider themselves inactive when a third-party widget opens a pop-up that is
  intended to be modal.  Multi-layered modality, such as a modal window that in turn pops a
  modal dialog, is yet more complex.
 
  <li> <b>bad CSS</b>: some third-party widgets introduce CSS selectors that target, for
  example, every table cell on the entire page.  This very bad practice will interfere with
  Smart GWT (or any other HTML on the page).  This may require modifying the third-party
  component, or extensively modifying Smart GWT CSS to reverse any changes caused by
  third-party CSS.  For example, it may be necessary to modify every Smart GWT CSS style
  that may be applied to a table cell to reverse a change in padding for all table cells that
  is introduced by bad third-party CSS.
 
 <li> <b>skinning</b>: third-party widgets may lack sufficient skinning APIs to allow you to
 match
  look and feel to SmartGWT, which may necessitate creating a custom SmartGWT skin to match
 the look and feel of third-party widgets (see <A HREF="../../../../com/smartgwt/client/docs/Skinning.html" title="interface in com.smartgwt.client.docs"><CODE>Skinning
 Overview</CODE></A>)
 
  <li> <b>event interference</b>: third-party widgets may register page-wide event handling
  logic that conflicts with or destroys similar event handling logic in Smart GWT.  For best
  results, load third-party JavaScript libraries <b>before</b> Smart GWT since Smart GWT
  makes a best effort to preserve any previously installed handlers and allows such handlers to
  cancel native browser behaviors if they do so.
 
  <li> <b>RTL / i18n</b>: third party widgets may not allow all user-visible messages to be
  replaced, a requirement for internationalization / localization, or they may not support
  RTL/BIDI (Right-To-Left / Bi-Directional) rendering
  </ul>
 
  Because of issues like the above, not all of which may be resolvable for some third-party
  widgets, we recommend the following overall approach:
  <ul>
  <li> avoid using third-party widgets if you can build equivalent functionality in
       Smart GWT
  <li> if the third-party component is completely non-interactive, either does not require
       ARIA markup or already includes such markup, and there are no conflicting look and feel
       issues, go ahead and use it
  <li> if you anticipate issues, consider the 
 <a href='http://www.smartclient.com/services/index.jsp#features'
 onclick="window.open('http://www.smartclient.com/services/index.jsp#features');return
 false;">Feature Sponsorship Program</a> 
       as a means of getting new supported functionality added to Smart GWT
  <li> search for existing posts and/or ask about the feasibility of integration on the
 <a href='http://forums.smartclient.com/'
 onclick="window.open('http://forums.smartclient.com/');return false;">Smart GWT Forums</a>.
  <li> finally, you could attempt to tackle the issues above on your own.  To avoid wasting
       time on dead ends, we would recommend assessing the amount of work involved in fixing
    <b>all</b> problems that need to be solved before attempting actual fixes for any one issue.
  </ul>
