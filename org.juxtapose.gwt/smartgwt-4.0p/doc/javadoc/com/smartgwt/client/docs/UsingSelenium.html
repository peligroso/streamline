<h3>Using Selenium</h3>
 <a href='http://seleniumhq.org/' onclick="window.open('http://seleniumhq.org/');return
 false;">Selenium</a> is a powerful and popular tool which can be used  to test your Smart GWT
 applications.  Selenium executes tests against your running application in a browser emulating
 user interaction  and asserting various conditions. Selenium provides a record/playback tool
 for authoring tests without  learning a test scripting language. You must be familiar with <a
 href='http://seleniumhq.org/' onclick="window.open('http://seleniumhq.org/');return
 false;">Selenium</a> and use of <a href='http://seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/'
 onclick="window.open('http://seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/');return false;">Selenium IDE</a>
 before proceeding.  Refer to the documentation on the Selenium site. <P> Selenium supports the
 concept of <a href='http://seleniumhq.org/docs/02_selenium_ide.html#locating-elements'
 onclick="window.open('http://seleniumhq.org/docs/02_selenium_ide.html#locating-elements');return
 false;">Locators</a> in order to specify the element you'd like a given Selenium command to
 target. For example Selenium supports XPath based locators and DOM ID based locators. XPath
 based locators are extremely fragile due to complexity of certain  highly nested DOM elements
 you need access to combined with the fact that XPath support varies across browsers and  so
 your tests might not work across different browsers.  <P> Use of Selenium with Smart GWT
 applications is no different than using Selenium to write and run test cases with  any other
 application with the exception of one caveat: Smart GWT occasionally renders a different DOM
 structure  depending on the browser for performance or rendering the UI such that it appears
 identical across various browsers.  As a result using DOM ID or DOM XPath based locators with
 Smart GWT applications is not advisable.  <P> Instead Smart GWT supports a new Selenium locator
 which is an XPath-like string used by Selenium to robustly identify  DOM elements within a
 Smart GWT application. Smart GWT locators for Selenium are prefixed by "scLocator=" and have a 
 readable XPath-like value even for cells in ListGrid's or TreeGrids. Typically these locators
 will not be hand-written and  are generated by <a href='http://seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/'
 onclick="window.open('http://seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/');return false;">Selenium IDE</a>,
 Selenium's test recording tool. One primary locator is based on the ID of the Smart GWT widget
 and has the syntax <b>ID=&lt;Canvas ID&gt;</b>. This simplifies the task of  writing tests if
 you know the ID of the Canvas. For reference, the scLocator syntax for ListGrid cells and
 DynamicForm  FormItems can be found at the end of this document. <P> <b>Setup Instructions</b>
 <P> Smart GWT ships with two Selenium user extension Javascript files:  <P> <ul> <li>
 user-extensions.js <li> user-entensions-ide.js </ul> <P> These extensions (found in the  
 <code>selenium/</code> directory) augment the Selenium tools to support Smart GWT locators. To
 integrate these extensions with Selenium,  follow the steps below: <P> <ul> <li> Confirm that
 the Selenium IDE has been installed. <li> Copy the user extension files listed above to a
 common location on your test client machine. <li> Open the Selenium IDE and click the Options
 ==&gt; Options... menu item. On the General tab enter the path to these extension  files in the
 corresponding fields: Selenium Core extensions and Selenium IDE extensions. Refer to the
 Selenium Documention  on <a
 href='http://seleniumhq.org/docs/08_user_extensions.html#using-user-extensions-with-selenium-ide'
 onclick="window.open('http://seleniumhq.org/docs/08_user_extensions.html#using-user-extensions-with-selenium-ide');return
 false;">user extensions</a>  for more information. <li> Close and restart Selenium IDE to load
 the new extensions. </ul> <P> That's it, we're done configuring the environment. <P> Note:
 Tests recorded using Selenium IDE can be played back using <a
 href='http://seleniumhq.org/projects/remote-control/'
 onclick="window.open('http://seleniumhq.org/projects/remote-control/');return false;">Selenium
 Remote Control</a>. The <code>user-extensions-ide.js</code> file is not required for playback
 of Smart GWT-aware tests using Selenium RC, but the  <code>user-extensions.js</code> is.
 Instructions for using <code>user-extensions.js</code> with Selenium RC can be found  <a
 href='http://seleniumhq.org/docs/08_user_extensions.html#using-user-extensions-with-selenium-rc'
 onclick="window.open('http://seleniumhq.org/docs/08_user_extensions.html#using-user-extensions-with-selenium-rc');return
 false;">here</a>. <P> <b>Recording Selenium tests with Selenium IDE</b> <P> Once you have your
 application running in Firefox, open Selenium IDE from the Tools ==&gt; Selenium IDE menu
 option. If the Selenium IDE is in record mode, then clicking or carrying out other operations
 like typing in a text field with automatically record the  appropriate Selenium commands with
 the Smart GWT locator. In most cases there's no need for you to manually enter the locator, 
 the recorder does this for you! In fact, not only do the provided user extension files record
 your clicks, drag operations, and  typing in the browser--they also try to ensure that your
 script executes each operaton only when the Smart GWT widgets it depends  upon exist and are
 ready to be interacted with.  This ensures that when the test script is executed, then even if
 one or more triggered  operations are asynchronous (delayed), it behaves as expected. <P> In
 the screenshot below, note the <b>waitForElementClickable()</b> operation above the click
 operation; it was added automatically by our  user extensions as the click itself was recorded:
 <P> <img src="skin/user-guide-images-selenium/selenium-ide-example.png" width="1017px"
 height="853px"> <P> Sometimes users may also want finer grain control of what Selenium command
 is created instead of having the Selenium IDE recorder  do this automatically. For example if
 you want to verify the value of a particular cell in a ListGrid. Instead of typing in the 
 command "verifyTable" and manually enter the Smart GWT Locator (scLocator), you can simply
 right click on the table cell or any  other Smart GWT widget and the most suitable Selenium
 commands will appear in the context menu along with the scLocator path for  the clicked
 element. See image below. <P> <img
 src="skin/user-guide-images-selenium/selenium-ide-example-verifyText.png" width="1211px"
 height="737px"> <P> <b>Solving Ordering Issues in Selenium Scripts</b> <P> Fundamentally, the
 reason we add <b>waitForElementClickable()</b> calls before each click is to deal with
 asynchronous Smart GWT operations. Many operations on widgets or the network are asynchronous,
 and a correctly coded test should wait for such operations to  complete as opposed to inserting
 an arbitrary delay or using Selenium's <b>setSpeed()</b> function. Using such delays runs the
 risk of  the test failing if replay occurs on a loaded machine or slow network, and also makes
 the test run slower than needed.  <P> Asynchronous operations include: <P> <ul> <li> any actual
 network operation, <li> any DataSource operation (even for a clientOnly DataSource), <li> any
 situation where a widget can be marked "dirty" (see notes at <b>Canvas.isDirty()</b>), and then
 asynchronously  redraw itself - this includes API calls like <b>ListGrid.setData()</b>,
 <b>Canvas.setContents()</b> as well as user interactions like  ListGrid sort or filter,
 regardless of whether the data is already present, <li> re-layout that occurs as a result of a
 size change or new member being added to a Layout or subclass of Layout (eg SectionStack,
 Window) </ul> <P> The following operations are synchronous and don't require waiting: <P> <ul>
 <li>draw()ing any widget that has no parent - but note adding a widget to an already-drawn
 Layout is asynchronous, as above </ul> <P> You may encounter cases where you have to manually
 insert a <b>waitForElementClickable()</b> or <b>waitForElementNotPresent()</b> to get a script
 to behave properly.  Looking at the Smart GWT Showcase Example (Grids >> Filtering >> Advanced
 Filter), suppose  we wanted to filter by country names containing "Za" and wait for the filter
 step to complete before proceeding.  Since the  ListGrid initially contains many entries and
 Zaire is not among them, it is not visible and thus we can solve the original  problem by
 manually adding a <b>waitForElementClickable()</b> on the locator for Zaire's ListGrid entry:
 <P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>scLocator=//ListGrid[ID="filterGrid"]/body/row[pk=216||countryCode=CG||215]/col[fieldName=countryCode||0]</b>
 <P> Before the filter operation is issued, the locator is not clickable because the record is
 not visible: <P> <img src="skin/user-guide-images-selenium/manual-wait-clickable-before.png"
 width="767px" height="327px"> <P> When the filter operation completes, Zaire and the other
 search results become visible and the <b>waitForElementClickable()</b>  returns successfully
 allowing the next script command to execute: <P> <img
 src="skin/user-guide-images-selenium/manual-wait-clickable-after.png" width="763px"
 height="328px"> <P> Finally, suppose you wanted to do another filter operation to look only at
 countries (from the previous search results) with  populations under 30 million.   Since Zaire
 is above this limit, it will be missing from the search results and you could  wait for the
 filter operation to complete by adding a <b>waitForElementNotPresent()</b> on same locator that
 we previously used  for <b>waitForElementClickable()</b>. It will return true and allow the
 script to proceed when the filter operation completes: <P> <img
 src="skin/user-guide-images-selenium/manual-wait-not-present.png" width="762px" height="317px">
 <P> <b>Waiting on Pending ListGrid Operations</b> <P> There are cases where
 <b>waitForElementClickable()/waitForElementNotPresent()</b> will not work--for example if
 you're performing  a sort that's rearranging existing elements on the screen, or if you're
 performing a filter operation where you're not sure of the results and thus cannot use the
 approach from the previous section.  In such a situation, you may need to add a 
 <b>waitForGridDone()</b> command into your script to ensure the pending operations are complete
 before you hit the next command. <P> The <b>waitForGridDone()</b> command guarantees it will
 not complete successfully unless all of the following potential pending  operations on the
 widget are complete: <P> <ul> <li> any fetch or filter operation (the result of applying
 criteria), <li> any sort operation (the result of apply sort specifiers), <li> the flush of
 pending FilterEditor criteria to the parent ListGrid, and <li> the saving of any newly edited
 rows. </ul> <P> This command should be able to block a Selenium script until the ListGrid
 specified in the locator reaches a stable drawn state with  no pending activity.  So for a
 ListGrid names 'filterGrid', all you'd need to add to ensure all pending operations on it have
 completed is the command: <P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>waitForGridDone("//ListGrid[ID='filterGrid']");</b> <P> <P>
 <b>Waiting on All Pending Network Operations</b> <P> Because of the
 <b>waitForElementClickable</b> commands which are automatically inserted during recording, your
 scripts will automatically wait for the completion of any network operations that block
 interactivity (via showPrompt, which is enabled by  default). However in some cases you may
 want to wait for all pending network operations to complete, even if they don't block user
 interactivity. <P> To do this, use <b>RPCManager.requestsArePending()</b> in combination with
 <b>waitForCondition()</b>. So, the JavaScript in your <b>waitForCondition()</b> operation would
 be: <P>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>!selenium.browserbot.getCurrentWindow().isc.RPCManager.requestsArePending()</b>
 <P> When the call returns, you'd know that any previously initiated network operations--such as
 filter/sort operations on DataSources--are  complete. <P> <b>Automatically Waiting on All
 Pending Network Operations</b> <P> If you need the functionality from the section above to wait
 on all pending network operations, but don't want to add extra calls to
 <b>waitForCondition()</b>, you may switch on automatic enforcement of the condition that
 <b>isc.RPCManager.requestsArePending()</b> is false.  There are two ways to do this: <P> <ul>
 <li> Set the property <b>isc.AutoTest.implicitNetworkWait</b> to true on the page under test
 after the ISC modules are loaded, or <li> Add the Selenium command
 <b>setImplicitNetworkWait(true)</b> to your selenium script in Selenium IDE. </ul> <P> Like
 other Selenium IDE commands with a single argument, you'll want to use
 <b>setImplicitNetworkWait()</b> by passing <b>true</b> (or <b>false</b>) in the Target field of
 the Selenium IDE GUI (right under command). Without any modifications, the default value  for
 <b>isc.AutoTest.implicitNetworkWait</b> of <b>false</b> will prevail. <P> <b>Disabling the
 Selenium Smart GWT URL Query String</b> <P> By default, our user extensions automatically add a
 special URL variable, <b>sc_selenium</b>, to open command urls to allow  JavaScript to detect
 it's being driven by Selenium in case special logic should be used.  In the unlikely event that
 this causes a  problem with your code or page loading and you don't need the feature, you may
 eliminate this special URL variable by changing
 <b>Selenium.prototype.use_url_query_sc_selenium</b> from <b>true</b> to <b>false</b> in
 user-extensions.js. <P> <hr> <P> <b><u>Common scLocator syntax</u></b> <P> For more information
 on how locators are formed and how to influence them, see the  AutoTest class in  the Smart GWT
 JavaDoc.  <P> <b><u>List Grid cells</u></b> <P>
 <b>//ListGrid[ID="itemList"]/body/row[itemID=1996||itemName=Sugar White
 1KG||SKU=85201400||1]/col[fieldName=SKU||1]</b> <P> <ul> <li> This assumes the ListGrid has an
 explicit ID <li> the 'body' part might be 'frozenBody' if the field in question was frozen <li>
 row[......] identifies the row (record) <li> itemID= - that's the primary key field from the
 dataSource the grid is bound to <li> itemName= - that's the title field value for the record
 <li> SKU=... - that's the cell the user clicked's value <li> 1 - that's the index of the row
 (rowNum) <li> col[.....] - identifies the column in the grid <li> fieldName=... - field name
 for the field the user clicked <li> 1 - that's the index of the column </ul> <P> <b><u>Form
 Items</u></b> <P>
 <b>//DynamicForm[ID="autoTestForm"]/item[name=textField||title=textField||value=test||index=0||Class=TextItem]/element</b>
 <P> This example is the data element (text entry box) for a text field  <P> <ul> <li> this form
 has an explicit ID <li> item[...] identifies the item <li> name (field name, if set) <li> title
 (title, if set) <li> value (current value if set) <li> index (index in the form items array)
 <li> Class (SC class of the item - in this case TextItem) after the "/" we identify the part of
 the item in question options here include: <li> "element" - the data element <li> "canvas" -
 for CanvasItems - points to the canvas embedded in the item <li> in this case the xpath might
 continue to contain, for example children of the canvas or elements within it (cells in a
 listGrid, etc) <li> "textbox" - the "text box" - this is the area where content is written out
 for items without a 'data element' - like header items <li> "[icon=&lt;...&gt;]" - the icon
 element -- "&lt;...&gt;" would contain the "name" of the icon </ul> <P> <hr> <P> <b><u>Best
 Practices</u></b> <P> <ul> <li> <b>Maximize the test browser window to avoid offscreen
 widgets</b>: Some browsers will not respond to events on widgets  that are not visible in the
 browser pane (scrolled out of view or clipped off). To avoid having to manually add script
 commands to  scroll such widgets into view, it's recommended to use Selenium's
 <b>windowMaximize()</b> command which will force the browser to  occupy the entire screen. <P>
 Note that currently some browsers will respond to events on offscreen widgets (IE will, Firefox
 will not) however, web standards  are unclear on whether this should be allowed and the
 behavior may change in the future, so best practice is to maximize for all  browsers. <P> <li>
 <b>Use setID() judiciously to ensure stable locators run-to-run</b>: When setID() is not used
 to supply a unique component ID, locators will sometimes incorporate automatically generated
 IDs which have a sequence number (eg isc_Object_355). If your test  has unpredictable execution
 order (for example, two simultaneous network operations take place and either may complete
 first,  and both generate UI components on completion) then these IDs will not be stable from
 run-to-run. They will likewise not be stable  if you test part of an app and then embed it in a
 larger app and try to use the same script. <P> Use setID() selectively to avoid this problem.
 Generally, it makes sense to use setID() on all top-level (parentless) widgets - at  this
 point, locators for children that do not have a unique ID will be based on the parent's ID plus
 a relative path. This relative  path will not incorporate auto-generated IDs and will generally
 continue to work even if the interior layout of the parent is  significantly rearranged (such
 as adding a new intervening container widget). </ul> <P> <hr> <P> <b><u>Known
 Limitations</u></b> <ul> <li> Selenium intermittently fails to generate an scLocator with the
 "type" command on some FormItems. If this occurs, you can  manually enter an scLocator into the
 target field, or use the drop down to select an alternative locator strategy (such as locating 
 a text input element by name). <li> Support for multi-select for SelectItems with selection
 mode "grid" (non-default) </ul> <P>
