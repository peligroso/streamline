Update overtake
 
 update		A		B
 			\		/
 				Obj1
 				A||B
 				 ||
				Obj2
			
			B overtakes A between update from Obj1 to Obj2
			Obj2 will be recalculated with data from "Obj1 update B" and then recalculated from "Obj2 update A"
			Leaving Obj2 in a state calculated from "Obj2 update A", which is stale.
				
Deadlock due to Transaction within Transaction Within Transaction
Is this a problem? or will it simply work?

Reference to Reference eternal loop

Race condition in Reference links
	If someone adds a reference and then removes a reference on two different threads the remove might be done before the add
	Since references are created/disposed outside of locking scheme.
	That will may cause a long chain of events to take place within the lock.
